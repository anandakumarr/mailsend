My Personal notes
=================
How to release
--------------
* pixel
  - compile windows binary
  - test by running test_gmail.sh

* t105
  - compile. run make docs
  - ldd mailsend to make sure libs are ok.
  - test by running test_gmail.sh
  - do a check-in 
  - run mk_release_svn_google.rb to branch and tag the release and create the tgz file.

  - create debian package by running mk_debian_package.rb

  - use googlecode_upload.pl to upload the tgz file
  - use googlecode_upload.pl to upload the deb file


  - cp mailsend.exe mailsendV.exe
  - zip mailsendV.zip mailsendV.exe
  - use googlecode_upload.pl to upload the zip file
  - ./changelog2wiki.rb > ../mailsend-wiki/ChangeLog.wiki; check-in
  - update version numbers in main page
  - update issue. Well if svn comment has Fixes Issue 6, it will be closed
automatically. Very clever!

  - deprecate old versions in google code

  - run cp_to_bins.rb
